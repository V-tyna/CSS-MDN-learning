All CSS documents were made by me in the process of studying CSS on the site https://developer.mozilla.org.
The materials (images, audio and video) contained in the repository folders belong to https://developer.mozilla.org.
I've finished MDN block: CSS â€” Styling the Web. That is my final result. 

Repository contain 3 assesments:
1) @media queries
2) test-school-project
3) final-test-layout-comprehension

Special thanks to MDN!
