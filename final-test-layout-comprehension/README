Final task was made by me in the process of studying CSS on the site https://developer.mozilla.org.
The materials contained in the repository belong to https://developer.mozilla.org.

This is final assessment "Fundamental layout comprehension".
MDN set the following tasks:
"You now need to implement your layout. The tasks you need to achieve are:
  1.To display the navigation items in a row, with an equal amount of space between the items.
  2.The navigation bar should scroll with the content and then become stuck at the top of the viewport when it reaches it.
  3.The image that is inside the article should have text wrapped around it.
  4.The <article> and <aside> elements should display as a two column layout. The columns should be a flexible size so that if the browser window shrinks smaller the columns become narrower.
  5.The photographs should display as a two column grid with a 1 pixel gap between the images.

You will not need to edit the HTML in order to achieve this layout and the techniques you should use are:
  • Positioning
  • Float
  • Flexbox
  • CSS Grid Layout"
  
All tasks have been completed in styles.css. I made a /* */ comment on each completed task in the css document.
